/*In this exercise, we use the Principal component anlaysis (PCA) to evaluate the Impact of 
development assistant on economic development though some indicators and a new index


Part 1: 

I. Principal component anlysis 

7. Run a principal component analysis on sample N=275 of the 
three variables of the policy index. 


 Initial sample size: N=275
 
 
 Policy index: the policy index (variable "policy") is the weighted average  of 
 the openess measure (variable "sacw"), the inflation rate (variable "infl") 
 and the budget surplus (variable "bb"), where the weights are  diven by the
 corresponding coefficients in the regression reported in table 4 colum 1. 
 The index is measured in terms of percentage points of GDP growth.
 
"In this work we considered the possiblity that the policy index should 
be treated as endogenous. (...) for simplicity, we treat poliy as exogenous".

"our model suggests that it is the distorsions that affect growth that will
 determine the effectiveness of aid. Therefore, we thought it was natural
 that our policy index should weight the policies according to their impact
 on growth, a feature that is absent from the principal component analysis.
 (...) The key feature of our policy index is that it weights the policy 
 variables according to their correlation with growth. (...) we use an 
 OLS regression of the growth equation with no aid term to fix the values 
 of the coefficients that determine the policy index"

 
 1st step: PCA of the three variables of the policy index.
 
 Principal component analysis is a statistical procedure that uses an 
orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly 
correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical
 values) into a set of value of linearly uncorrelated variables called
 principal components. If there are n observations (here, n=275) with p
 variables (here, p=3), then the number of distinct principal components 
 is min(n-1, p)=min (274,3)=3.
 The resulting vectors are each one a linear combination of the variables
 and contain n observations and an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set.
Mathematically, the transoformation is defined by a set of p dimensional 
vectors of weights or coefficient wk=(w1,...wp) that map each row vector
 x of X to a new vector of principal component scores t=(t1,...tl) given 
 by tk=x*w
 PCA can be used to reduce the number of variables  by describing a series
 of uncorrelated linear combinations of the variables that contain most of the variance
 or to learn about the underlying structure of the data. All principal components 
 combined contain the same information as the original variables, but the important
 information is partitioned over the components in a particular way: the components
 are orthohonal and earlier components contain more information than later compoenents.
 
 In stata, pca shows 2 panels. The first panel lists the eigenvalues of the 
 correlation matrix, from largest to smallest. The corresponding egeinvectors are 
 listed in the second panel. The eigenvalues are the variances of the principal components.

/*Burnside and Dollar: "we consider a number of alternative methods. 
 The first method we considered was a simple principal components approach
 that is, using the first principal component in our analysis rather than
 all three policy variables. Unfortunately, in our sample the first two
 principal components are almost perfectly correlated with openness and 
 inflation, respectively. Thus, the principal components approach did not
 lead us to a natural single index measure of policy. Instead, it effectively
 suggested that we drop the budget surplus variable and include both openness
 and inflation in our regression."*/

 1. Arrellano and Bond GMM (panel data regression with policy, aid and policy*aid_GDP
 with only lag(1) as instruments
 
 
 Arellano-Bond estimator:  generalized method of moments esitmator used to estimate
 dynamic panel data models. (dynamic= which include lagged levels of the dependent
 vriable as regresor => no strict exogeneity because the lagged dependent variable
 is necessarily correlated with the idiosyncratic error.). In the Arellano-Bond method,
 first difference of the regression equation are taken to eliminate the fixed effects.
 Then, deeper lags of the dependent variable are used as instruments for differenced
 lags of the dependent variable (which are endogenous). In traditional panel data
 techniques, Adding deeper lags of the dependent variable reduces the number of
 observations available. For example, if observations are available at T time 
 periods, then, after first differencing, only T-1 lags are usuable. If K lags
 of the dependent variable are used as instruents, only T-K-1 obs are usable
 in the regression â†’ trade off btw more lags ie more IV but smaller sample size 
â†’ the arellano-bond method circumvents this problem = general estimators designed 
for situations with small T, large N panels with independent variables that are not
 strictly exogenous meaning they are correlated with past , fixed effect, 
 heteroskedasticity and autocorr.

*+ time invariant country characteristics (fixed effects) such as geography and 
*demographics may be correlated with the explanatory variables 
*+ the presence of the lagged dependent variable gives rise to autocorrelation
*+ the panel dataset has a short time dimension (T=6) and a larger country dimension (N=36)
*(in large T panels, a shock to the country's fixed effect which shows in the error
*term will decline with time and the correlation of the lagged dependent variable
*wth the error term will be insignificant (Roodman, 2006) -> Arellano-Bond estimaor useless in this case)

 *GMM maybe better than 2SLS when the IV is weak. Indeed, with weak 
 *instruments, the fixed effects IV estimators are likely to be biased.
 
  
/*11 Run again the GMM estimation using a smaller number of instruments 
than in 13, such that there is at least one instrument more than variable
 to be instrumented, and keeping only the lagged levels used as instrument
 which seems to have the largest simple correlation with some of the
 first  differences. Comment. */
 
 *- determine the lagged levels used as IV which seems to have the largest
 * simple correlation with some of the first differences
 
 *1) genererating lagged variables /*
  
so country year
bysort country: gen eda_ret=eda[_n-1]
bysort country: gen policy_ret=policy[_n-1]
bysort country: gen edapolicy_ret=edapolicy[_n-1]

*2)lag 2:
so country year
bysort country: gen eda_ret2=eda[_n-2]
bysort country: gen policy_ret2=policy[_n-2]
bysort country: gen edapolicy_ret2=edapolicy[_n-2]

*lag 3
so country year
bysort country: gen eda_ret3=eda[_n-3]
bysort country: gen policy_ret3=policy[_n-3]
bysort country: gen edapolicy_ret3=edapolicy[_n-3]

* for lag>2, a lot of NA generated -> we stop at lag=2
 
 *3) generate first differences

bysort country: gen eda_diff=eda[_n]-eda[_n-1]
bysort country: gen edapolicy_diff=edapolicy[_n]-edapolicy[_n-1]
bysort country: gen policy_diff=policy[_n]-policy[_n-1]
 
foreach var in eda policy edapolicy{
display "`var'"
corr `var'_diff `var'
corr `var'_ret `var'
corr `var'_ret `var'_diff
corr `var'_ret2 `var'_diff
corr `var'_ret3 `var'_diff
}

foreach var in eda policy edapolicy{
display "`var'"
corr `var'_ret `var'_diff
corr `var'_ret2 `var'_diff
corr `var'_ret3 `var'_diff
}

*-> lag 2 seems the more correlated with first difference
 
 *What is 13???
